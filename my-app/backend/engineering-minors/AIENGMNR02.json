Neural networks are first described and how training can be achieved with backpropagation. Various forms of deep neural networks are developed, such as multilayer perceptrons, convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The mathematics of stochastic optimisation is used to interpret and understand the behaviour and training of these networks. Programming approaches are discussed for training and deploying neural networks. Deep learning technologies and design examples are discussed in areas such as driverless cars, personal cognitive assistants and mastering of games such as GO.Read More about Overview",

Neural networks are first described and how training can be achieved with backpropagation. Various forms of deep neural networks are developed, such as multilayer perceptrons, convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The mathematics of stochastic optimisation is used to interpret and understand the behaviour and training of these networks. Programming approaches are discussed for training and deploying neural networks. Deep learning technologies and design examples are discussed in areas such as driverless cars, personal cognitive assistants and mastering of games such as GO.Read More about Overview",
