Time series will introduce the concepts of stochastic processes, wide-sense stationarity, autocovariance functions and spectral density. This will lead to the analysis of ARMA (p,g) processes using MATLAB. Matrix decomposition includes singular value decomposition with applications including data compression, image processing, noise filtering and finding exact and approximate solutions of linear systems. Numerical methods for working efficiently with large matrices and handling ill-conditioned data will be discussed. Methods for unconstrained and constrained optimisation will be presented, with the use of MATLAB.Read More about Overview",

Interactive data visualisation is now common in business, engineering and design and the social and physical sciences. This unit introduces the main kinds of information graphics and interactive visualisation systems and their areas of application. It investigates the reasons why visualisation can be effective and based on this students will gain experience in critically assessing data visualisations and in designing their own visualisations. You will learn how to create visualisations with representative computer tools and gain experience in creating a data visualisation for an application domain of their choice.Read More about Overview",

Examples include turbomachinery, vehicle aerodynamics and aeronautics. It is also a powerful research tool and is being increasingly used to answer fundamental questions in a wide range of fields, from astrophysics to nanomaterials. This Unit provides an introduction to this mathematically sophisticated discipline. This involves a review of the equations governing motion and energy of fluids, the mathematical properties of these equations and the relevance of such properties to obtaining numerical solutions. The basics of numerical discretization and solution methods will be discussed. The Unit will also introduce you to using commercial CFD packages in analysing complex industrial problems involving fluids.Read More about Overview",
