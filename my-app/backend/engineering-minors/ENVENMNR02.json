From powering household appliances and gas heaters to driving a car across town, it is responsible for making everything that involves movement or activity happen. Although energy cannot be created or destroyed, it is still important for the available energy within our environment to be conserved and used wisely. Our decisions on how we use energy impact the plant's natural systems in complex ways. It is vital that we choose our energy sources carefully and be mindful of the amount of energy we use. The true cost of energy is more than just dollars and cents; there are important environmental and political factors and consequences to consider.\nThis unit provides a qualitative and quantitative survey of the physics behind conventional and alternative energy sources.
