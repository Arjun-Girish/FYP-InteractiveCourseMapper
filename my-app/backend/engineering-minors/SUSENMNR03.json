From powering household appliances and gas heaters to driving a car across town, it is responsible for making everything that involves movement or activity happen. Although energy cannot be created or destroyed, it is still important for the available energy within our environment to be conserved and used wisely. Our decisions on how we use energy impact the plant's natural systems in complex ways. It is vital that we choose our energy sources carefully and be mindful of the amount of energy we use. The true cost of energy is more than just dollars and cents; there are important environmental and political factors and consequences to consider.\nThis unit provides a qualitative and quantitative survey of the physics behind conventional and alternative energy sources.

The unit focuses on the processes involved in producing a comprehensive\u00a0approach to identifying, assessing and planning management processes, with a particular\u00a0emphasis on synthesising technical, regulatory and community issues. The unit aims to\u00a0encourage you to integrate your existing knowledge in environmental engineering, applying it\u00a0to real projects. Through lectures, practice classes, individual assignments and group project\u00a0work, you should develop skills and knowledge in preparing major EIA, ERA and EMS\u00a0reports, your presentation and communication as well as your engineering context.Read More about Overview",

Major technologies relating to the production, sustainable use and recycling of metals, plastics, glass, electronics, paper and ceramic materials are discussed. Various options involving materials substitution, reclamation, energy recovery and disposal are critically evaluated. The unit considers the economics of materials production, as well as 'cradle-to-grave' analyses of materials, including products and byproducts of the nuclear fuel cycle. In particular, it looks at various life-cycle analysis techniques. We will examine the impact of population, affluence and technology changes on population and ecological footprints with the arrival of the current \"Anthropocene Era\".Read More about Overview",
