The course covers the development of geothermal energy sources for power (from exploration to development and production), as well as alternative uses for these resources. You will learn about the fundamental processes involved in heat and mass transport in the subsurface, as well as the physics and chemistry involved in electricity production. The course also covers recent developments in geothermal energy - new drilling techniques, enhanced geothermal systems, mineral co-production and low-temperature geothermal systems. You will also be provided with an introduction to the economics surrounding geothermal energy systems.Read More about Overview",
