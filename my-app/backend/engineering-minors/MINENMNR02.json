The machine excavation includes fundamentals of rock cutting, cutting with discs and design of cutter heads along with the assessment of rock cuttability applicable to soft and hard rock underground spaces, such as civil and water drainage tunnels and subways. The drilling and blasting component includes the impact of blasting not on the behaviour of rock mass properties, structure and discontinuities and rock breakage and fragmentation. Drilling and blasting techniques will be explored in relation to design, safety, security, environmental impacts and relevant legislation. This will be done in the context of mine-to-mill.Read More about Overview",
