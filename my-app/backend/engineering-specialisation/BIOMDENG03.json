This unit covers the key events involved in early human development, including gametogenesis, fertilisation, blastocyst formation and implantation, generation of germ layers and cellular derivatives. You will explore how the many specialised cell types in the adult human body are derived from a single fertilised egg, how molecular and cellular mechanisms regulate development, and how issues with these mechanisms can result in developmental disorders. You will learn about the development and microanatomy of a range of cell types, which provides foundational information on organ formation that you will build on in DEV2022. Finally, you will explore the roles of embryonic and adult stem cells, the potential for the use of these cells in medicine, and how cutting-edge developmental biology experiments are performed.\nYou will gain a range of skills in studying developmental biology that are transferable to different postgraduate areas of study and career paths such as biomedical research, medicine and allied health professions, and industry.\u00a0 The skills gained from completing DEV2011 assessment tasks include experimental techniques, critical thinking, investigative research skills, communication and project management.Read More about Overview",

The unit introduces concepts of continuous-time and discrete-time signals, their sampling and aliasing issues. Complex numbers, in particular, complex exponentials are introduced along with their representation as phasors, leading to periodic waveforms, Fourier series and the signal frequency spectrum. Modification of spectra will be described using FIR filters, discrete-time systems, the unit-sample response, discrete convolution, linear time-invariant systems, convolution integrals, the continuous-time Fourier transform, windowing, DFT, FFT, time-frequency spectrum analysis, spectrogram, and Laplace Transform. Connecting frequency response and time response completes the unit.Read More about Overview",

This material is taught through four successive themes that progressively build up the discipline knowledge and broader organisation, communication and management skills of science. Themes 1 and 2 (Foundations) explain cell structure and nerve organisation and function. Theme 3 (Communication systems) develops that knowledge base to study fast and slow inter-cell communication systems. Theme 4 (Sensory systems) shows how the systems of touch, pain, hearing, vision, taste and smell detect the world and how the brain analyses that information. Theme 5 (Control and response systems) details how the body responds through movement of limbs and the action of internal organs, and hormone systems. Normal physiology and common dysfunctions of the systems are studied, to allow for a greater understanding of the normal physiology, and an appreciation of dysfunctions.Read More about Overview",

You will examine the roles of three major body systems that are vital for homeostasis: the respiratory system and gas exchange, the cardiovascular system and delivery of blood and nutrients, and the kidneys and their role in maintaining body fluid composition. You will consider each system at rest and in a variety of active states, and the role of control mechanisms in each system. In addition to core physiological principles you will be introduced to disease states associated with dysfunctions of these systems to allow for a greater understanding and appreciation of both the normal physiology and dysfunction of these systems.Read More about Overview",
