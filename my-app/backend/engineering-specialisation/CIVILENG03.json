It builds on aspects taught in the level 1 unit, ENG1001. Topics covered include: bending moment diagrams of determinate and indeterminate beam and frame systems, the combination of bi-axial bending and axial stresses (including those resulting from thermal loading); partial and fully plastic section moment capacities; torsion, shear stress and shear flow in beams; and the calculation of reactions and deflections in both determinate and indeterminate systems using both compatibility and the energy method. The theory of elasticity is introduced, covering: the transformation of stress and strain and the calculation of principal and maximum shear stresses and strains; the constitutive relationship between elastic stress-strain behaviour; Mohr's circle; and failure criterion with specific reference to pressure vessels.Read More about Overview",

The fundamental parameters used to describe deterministic traffic flow behaviour are introduced along with a simple traffic flow model. Stochastic traffic flow behaviour is described via random distributions. Fundamental queuing theory of traffic is briefly introduced. The procedures used to analyse the capacity and level of service are explored for both unsignalised and signalised intersections. The principle of traffic signal operation at isolated intersections is presented. Traffic surveys are discussed. You are introduced to contemporary road safety issues as well. Public transport is considered at the route level concerning the determination of fleet size and factors affecting operational capacity and reliability. Non-motorised transport including cyclists and pedestrians is also considered. In addition, the unit addresses Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Consideration will also be given to the role of communications in the practice of transport and traffic engineers. To enhance your understanding of the unit content from practical points of view, some experts will be invited to give lectures on their relevant work. Throughout the whole unit, the focus is primarily on surface transport systems and applications of advanced technologies therein.Read More about Overview",

It also addresses how to determine relevant foundation design parameters from field and laboratory tests. It teaches the detailed design of shallow foundations (isolated footing, raft foundation) for simple and complex ground and load conditions. Finally, the design of single and group pile foundations in soils and rocks subjected to axial and lateral loads are taught including an introduction to pile integrity and load tests.Read More about Overview",

You will learn about the ways in which these different materials can be disposed of, ranging from incineration, recycling and degradation, and the technologies involved in these processes. The advantages of these methods, as opposed simply to landfill, will be discussed. Methods of sorting of different materials from the waste stream into their various components will also be covered.Read More about Overview",

The unit provides a detailed understanding of mining processes and systems engineering along with their key drivers in modern open-cut and underground operations. For each of the mining methods explored consideration is given to the mining cycle and access design - eg shafts and/or declines and materials handling. Through practical applications, you will explore the selection of optimal mining systems. For each of the mining systems covered, core risk identification and mitigation are considered.Read More about Overview",

The machine excavation includes fundamentals of rock cutting, cutting with discs and design of cutter heads along with the assessment of rock cuttability applicable to soft and hard rock underground spaces, such as civil and water drainage tunnels and subways. The drilling and blasting component includes the impact of blasting not on the behaviour of rock mass properties, structure and discontinuities and rock breakage and fragmentation. Drilling and blasting techniques will be explored in relation to design, safety, security, environmental impacts and relevant legislation. This will be done in the context of mine-to-mill.Read More about Overview",

This is a field of practice growing in importance in Australia and overseas, and will equip you well for careers in urban water management. The scope of the course will be multi-disciplinary, giving you an understanding of the range of perspectives required in integrated urban water management (IUWM) covering structural and non-structural techniques available. The social science and ecological perspectives will be emphasised to give an appreciation of the multi-disciplinary nature of IUWM. Software packages such as MUSIC and Aquacycle will be introduced.Read More about Overview",
