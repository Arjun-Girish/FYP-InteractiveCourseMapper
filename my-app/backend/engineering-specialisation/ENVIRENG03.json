From powering household appliances and gas heaters to driving a car across town, it is responsible for making everything that involves movement or activity happen. Although energy cannot be created or destroyed, it is still important for the available energy within our environment to be conserved and used wisely. Our decisions on how we use energy impact the plant's natural systems in complex ways. It is vital that we choose our energy sources carefully and be mindful of the amount of energy we use. The true cost of energy is more than just dollars and cents; there are important environmental and political factors and consequences to consider.\nThis unit provides a qualitative and quantitative survey of the physics behind conventional and alternative energy sources.

You will gain a basic understanding of the structure and properties of the main classes of materials: metals, polymers and ceramics. You will learn about the ways in which these different materials can be disposed of, ranging from incineration, recycling and degradation, and the technologies involved in these processes. The advantages of these methods, as opposed simply to landfill, will be discussed. Methods of sorting of different materials from the waste stream into their various components will also be covered.Read More about Overview",

The key features of the main components of the hydrologic cycle (i.e., rainfall, streamflow, and evapotranspiration) are presented along with methods to measure and model them in natural and urban environments. Particular emphasis is on flooding and designed floods. The unit also provides an overview of the various water systems in an urban environment, their functions and modes of operation, and the influence of climate variability on urban requirements in terms of management and discharge of stormwater. A final aspect is the activation and transport of contaminants within the urban water cycle.Read More about Overview",

Ecology and biodiversity forms the foundation for understanding conservation and the management of genetics, species and ecosystem diversity. The approach taken is to address core ecological theory, but with an emphasis on contemporary management issues and applications. Topics include the scope and approaches of ecological enquiry; abiotic and biotic factors determining distributions; population growth and regulation; species interactions; patterns and maintenance of biodiversity; food web analysis; disturbance and succession; and production ecology and nutrient cycling. Particular emphasis is placed on integrating ecological processes across spatial and temporal scales. Practical work will be completed via a field excursion together with in-laboratory practical sessions.Read More about Overview",

Recent losses of biota have been caused by habitat loss and degradation, climate change and pollution, the introduction of exotic species and overexploitation of natural resources. Science-based conservation measures are explored that may reduce loss of biodiversity/ecosystem function, including habitat preservation and restoration, combating climate change, and intensive conservation of species.

The fundamental parameters used to describe deterministic traffic flow behaviour are introduced along with a simple traffic flow model. Stochastic traffic flow behaviour is described via random distributions. Fundamental queuing theory of traffic is briefly introduced. The procedures used to analyse the capacity and level of service are explored for both unsignalised and signalised intersections. The principle of traffic signal operation at isolated intersections is presented. Traffic surveys are discussed. You are introduced to contemporary road safety issues as well. Public transport is considered at the route level concerning the determination of fleet size and factors affecting operational capacity and reliability. Non-motorised transport including cyclists and pedestrians is also considered. In addition, the unit addresses Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Consideration will also be given to the role of communications in the practice of transport and traffic engineers. To enhance your understanding of the unit content from practical points of view, some experts will be invited to give lectures on their relevant work. Throughout the whole unit, the focus is primarily on surface transport systems and applications of advanced technologies therein.Read More about Overview",

The estimation procedure used by a geologist or engineer should incorporate efforts to minimise errors and assumptions at every level of decision.\nThis unit focuses on resource and reserve estimation of mineral ores and hydrocarbon deposits, with particular focus on the influence of the in situ geological conditions. You will learn the basics of resource and reserve reporting with particular reference to applicable industry codes. Resource modelling will be taught through computer applications with special consideration of geostatistical techniques.Read More about Overview",

The drilling and blasting component includes the impact of blasting not on the behaviour of rock mass properties, structure and discontinuities and rock breakage and fragmentation. Drilling and blasting techniques will be explored in relation to design, safety, security, environmental impacts and relevant legislation.

This is a field of practice growing in importance in Australia and overseas, and will equip you well for careers in urban water management. The scope of the course will be multi-disciplinary, giving you an understanding of the range of perspectives required in integrated urban water management (IUWM) covering structural and non-structural techniques available. The social science and ecological perspectives will be emphasised to give an appreciation of the multi-disciplinary nature of IUWM. Software packages such as MUSIC and Aquacycle will be introduced.Read More about Overview",
