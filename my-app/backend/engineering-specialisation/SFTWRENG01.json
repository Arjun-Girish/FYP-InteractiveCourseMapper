This has been described by some social commentators as the rise of \"big data\" and and the analysts and practitioners who investigate this data as \"data scientists.\" This unit will introduce students to the analysis of big data and the role of the data scientist. Techniques covered include data management and transformation, visual analysis, social network analysis, statistical learning, clustering and natural language processing. Students will be introduced to these methods using open source industry standard software. Data and case studies will be drawn from diverse sources. The general principles of analysis, investigation and reporting will be covered. Students will be encouraged to critically reflect on the data analysis process within their own domain of interest.Read More about Overview",

Learning and the different kinds of learning will be covered and their usage discussed. Evaluation techniques and typical application contexts will presented. A series of different models and algorithms will be presented in an exploratory way: looking at typical data, the basic models and algorithms and their use: linear and logistic regression, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, decision trees, random forests, k-means and clustering, neural-networks, deep learning, and others. Finally, two specialist topics will be covered briefly, statistical learning theory and working with big data.Read More about Overview",

Students are provided with a range of practical exercises and tasks to reinforce their skills including: identification of security bugs in programs written in different programming languages, design, implementation, and testing of secure concurrent and networked applications, identification of vulnerabilities in networked and mobile/wireless applications. In addition, students will learn input validation techniques to minimise security risks, man-in-the-middle attack techniques to be able to build more secure networked applications, practical secure software testing techniques to be able to test applications for security bugs.Read More about Overview",

Advancements in cloud services, mobile computing, and machine learning bring much convenience to our lives, improve our productivity in daily work, and provide us with personalised services. Despite many benefits, these new paradigms incur aggravated security and privacy concerns. End-users, enterprises, and governments face growing threats from sophisticated cyber attacks. This unit will study advanced cybersecurity technologies to address those threats in the current practice. Topics include design and implementation of advanced cryptosystems for high-performance applications such as encrypted databases, cryptographic protocols and hardware-assisted approaches for secure computing applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning, and practical post-quantum cryptography that can address the emerging threats of quantum computers. Learning activities will focus on understanding security and privacy issues in cloud and networked systems, encrypted search techniques, cloud storage security, secure multi-party computation techniques, trusted computing, and lattice-based cryptography.Read More about Overview",

Working with data as part of a business model and the lifecycle in an organisation is considered, as well as business processes and case studies. Data and its handling is also introduced: characteristic kinds of data and its collection, data storage and basic kinds of data preparation, data cleaning and data stream processing. Styles of data analysis and outcomes of successful data exploration and analysis are reviewed. Standards, tools and resources are also reviewed. Basic curation and management are reviewed: archival and architectural practice, policy, legal and ethical issues.Read More about Overview",

Autonomous agents are active agents that independently execute actions to achieve a certain goal or goals. These agents perceive their environment and reason and plan in order to effect their environment and achieve their goals. This is a very popular and highly researched AI approach and has many significant implications beyond the traditional area of AI (optimisation, robotics, scheduling, etc?). This course will give students the foundations to develop and design their own autonomous agents.Read More about Overview",

You will examine definitions of evidence as they apply to investigations involving the seizure and examination of information technology devices. The unit will introduce you to various tools, techniques and algorithms that may be employed by investigators for acquisition, preservation, and analysis of evidence. Disk-based (local) and network (remote) forensic environments will be explored. You will also learn of the impediments and complicating factors that can threaten forensic investigations.Read More about Overview",

It offers on-demand resources and subscription-based services in a pay-as-you-go model to individual and corporate end-users. Cloud computing facilitates setup, implementation, maintenance, and management of the integrated computation and storage services. This unit will enable students to develop a basic knowledge of cloud computing technology and design and implement cloud applications using cloud services. It also introduces the security and privacy issues of the off-the-shelf cloud services. Learning activities will focus on understanding cloud delivery and service models, identifying various cloud platforms, and fundamental cloud technologies such as virtualisation, containers, serverless, web services and their security challenges.Read More about Overview",
