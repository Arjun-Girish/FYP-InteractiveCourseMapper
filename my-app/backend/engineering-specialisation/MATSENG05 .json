Phase diagrams and the key concepts of Gibbs energy and chemical potential are used to explain the equilibrium between phases and to predict the microstructures of materials. The mechanisms of new phase formation are discussed in terms of both the driving forces and kinetics of formation, including the role of atomic diffusion. What happens when the thermodynamically stable microstructural state cannot develop is discussed and metastable microstructures are considered in detail. Throughout the unit, technologically important materials systems are used to illustrate these concepts.Read More about Overview",

Plastic deformation will explore the importance of dislocations in yielding, and deformation via twinning will also be introduced.

The functional materials will be studied at the microscopic (atomic and/or molecular) level in order to gain an understanding of the device operation. The particular focus of this unit is on the electronic properties of materials (metals, semiconductors and insulators) based on their energy band structures. The classical and wave-mechanical models of metals are introduced along with the Fermi energy, density of states, forbidden band and Brillouin zones, to describe the behaviour of free electrons in solids. Semiconductor fabrication processes such as single crystal growth, film deposition and microlithography will also be introduced briefly.Read More about Overview",

Major technologies relating to the production, sustainable use and recycling of metals, plastics, glass, electronics, paper and ceramic materials are discussed. Various options involving materials substitution, reclamation, energy recovery and disposal are critically evaluated. The unit considers the economics of materials production, as well as 'cradle-to-grave' analyses of materials, including products and byproducts of the nuclear fuel cycle. In particular, it looks at various life-cycle analysis techniques.

In almost all structural applications the principle loads are carried by engineering alloys. The reasons underlying this choice are discussed and the general methodology used to choose a material for use in a new application is presented. The link between processing, microstructure and properties is emphasized. A selection of engineering alloys, including steels (carbon, alloy, stainless, dual-phase, TRIP/TWIP), cast irons, aluminium, magnesium, titanium, nickel and cobalt-based superalloys and zirconium alloys, is discussed. The state-of-the-art approaches to the design and development of new alloys for the 21st century are outlined.Read More about Overview",
