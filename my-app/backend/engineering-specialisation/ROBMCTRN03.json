The unit introduces concepts of continuous-time and discrete-time signals, their sampling and aliasing issues. Complex numbers, in particular, complex exponentials are introduced along with their representation as phasors, leading to periodic waveforms, Fourier series and the signal frequency spectrum. Modification of spectra will be described using FIR filters, discrete-time systems, the unit-sample response, discrete convolution, linear time-invariant systems, convolution integrals, the continuous-time Fourier transform, windowing, DFT, FFT, time-frequency spectrum analysis, spectrogram, and Laplace Transform. Connecting frequency response and time response completes the unit.Read More about Overview",

Secondly, you are shown how to write algorithms for efficient numerical solution of these equations. Computer-aided control systems design using optimal and robust control methods is then covered. Thirdly, you are introduced to Lyapunov and function analytic techniques for nonlinear systems stability analysis, and to nonlinear control design methods including feedback linearisation, sliding mode and passivity-based control techniques.Read More about Overview",

Then, congestion in telecommunication networks is covered, and effectiveness of various congestion and flow control algorithms and protocols are investigated. The focus then shifts to individual links and nodes, and queuing theory is introduced and its applications in networks are analysed.

It includes compression of multimedia from basic information theoretic concepts through to advanced video (e.g. MPEG), image (JPEG, JPEG2000) and audio (CELP, MP3, AAC, Dolby Digital) coding. XML-based metadata systems are used to illustrate concepts of content characterisation and discovery. The ability of modern network protocols to support media streaming is related directly to service requirements such as error and delay tolerance. Where media is intended for human consumption, the characteristics of human perception of image and sound determine minimum quality requirements, but also reveal limitations that can be exploited when compressing media data. Machine interpretation and analysis of multimedia is also investigated. Case studies in media analysis (e.g. Shazam), delivery (video on demand) and consumption (digital cinema) are used to illustrate the technologies investigated.Read More about Overview",

Neural networks are first described and how training can be achieved with backpropagation. Various forms of deep neural networks are developed, such as multilayer perceptrons, convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The mathematics of stochastic optimisation is used to interpret and understand the behaviour and training of these networks. Programming approaches are discussed for training and deploying neural networks. Deep learning technologies and design examples are discussed in areas such as driverless cars, personal cognitive assistants and mastering of games such as GO.Read More about Overview",

Different manufacturing systems: cellular and flexible manufacturing systems will be analysed. Recent advancement in the industry: Industry 4.0 and digital twins will be introduced. Modern manufacturing management will be presented and discussed to improve quality and productivity by removing non-value added processes to reduce the production cycle and increase the product life-cycle. This will include lean manufacturing, agile manufacturing and virtual manufacturing. This unit also includes the design of flexible manufacturing systems which is capable of producing a variety of products. The manufacturing support systems such as process planning and control and computer-aided process planning using a variant technique and a generative process planning technique with Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be covered in this unit.
