Topics include control volume analysis of viscous incompressible flow, channel and pipe flow, boundary layer flow and free shear flows like jets and wakes, including momentum integral analysis, similarity analysis and similarity solutions of these equations as they pertain to wall-bounded and free shear flows and an introduction to turbulence. Convective heat transfer in these laminar and turbulent flows is also considered.Read More about Overview",

Geometric and economic tolerancing is further explored. The use of solid modelling software to simulate the behaviour of mechanical devices and produce engineering drawings is introduced. The integration of design skills and related engineering studies is covered through a group exercise to design a mechanical device.Read More about Overview",

You will be instructed on the fundamentals of the role of composition and structure of materials in their mechanical properties that are important for engineering design. You will also learn how the materials with undesirable microstructure can lead to premature failures, particularly as a result of their interaction with aggressive environment. The knowledge thus developed will provide a basis for advanced learning on a systematic approach to materials selection as well as the methods by which the materials with the desired mechanical properties can be processed. Case studies will be presented to highlight the importance of selecting appropriate materials for engineering design.Read More about Overview",

It is also a powerful research tool and is being increasingly used to answer fundamental questions in a wide range of fields, from astrophysics to nanomaterials. This Unit provides an introduction to this mathematically sophisticated discipline. This involves a review of the equations governing motion and energy of fluids, the mathematical properties of these equations and the relevance of such properties to obtaining numerical solutions. The basics of numerical discretization and solution methods will be discussed. The Unit will also introduce you to using commercial CFD packages in analysing complex industrial problems involving fluids.Read More about Overview",

An introduction will be given to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The evolution of key technologies, transformation to digital chains and the need to seamlessly combine organisational and technological issues into a single framework will be discussed. A real-life scenario will be used to motivate you to apply CPS technologies to design and develop Smart Systems in any domain of their specialisation and interest. Using the concept of Learning Factories (LF) - a platform to impart experience-based knowledge - the developed solution will be built and tested as a group project.Read More about Overview",
