Large-scale software projects are a critical part of all engineering fields in industry. Perhaps a chemical engineering firm might need a system to simulate biochemical reactions to find better ways for producing green hydrogen. Or a civil engineering firm might need to identify the relationship between changes to playground designs and their impact on safety. Through this unit, you will work on a large-scale software project (web application) in remote teams working independently and collaboratively. The project will give you an appreciation of how large software projects can be decomposed into smaller segments, built and integrated into individual systems. You also gain an understanding of the abilities and limitations of such systems (within the context of web development) and learn methodological processes that support this. You will develop programming skills for web development (HTML, CSS and Javascript). Some prior programming knowledge would be advantageous, but not required.Read More about Overview",

This includes casting, CNC machining, powder metallurgy and metal forming. For each of these processes, you will learn about each of their strengths, limitations, cost and sustainability aspects. This will enable you to objectively select an appropriate technique for a particular set of requirements. You will also learn to design components that leverage the strengths of each of the different processes to optimally achieve the desired outcomes. You will also have the opportunity to work o a project that put these into practice and gain some hands-on experience.Read More about Overview",
