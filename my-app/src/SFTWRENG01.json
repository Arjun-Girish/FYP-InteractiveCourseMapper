Advancements in cloud services, mobile computing, and machine learning bring much convenience to our lives, improve our productivity in daily work, and provide us with personalised services. Despite many benefits, these new paradigms incur aggravated security and privacy concerns. End-users, enterprises, and governments face growing threats from sophisticated cyber attacks. This unit will study advanced cybersecurity technologies to address those threats in the current practice. Topics include design and implementation of advanced cryptosystems for high-performance applications such as encrypted databases, cryptographic protocols and hardware-assisted approaches for secure computing applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning, and practical post-quantum cryptography that can address the emerging threats of quantum computers. Learning activities will focus on understanding security and privacy issues in cloud and networked systems, encrypted search techniques, cloud storage security, secure multi-party computation techniques, trusted computing, and lattice-based cryptography.Read More about Overview",

This unit will explore the core concepts and applications of sustainable chemical engineering through interesting case studies drawn from food, water and energy engineering presented by a mix of academic specialists and industry representatives in each area.\nThe basic principles of the discipline will be introduced, including heat and material transfer, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, (bio)chemical reactions engineering and process design/control. Chemical engineering concepts will be developed within workshops and practicals complemented with practical laboratory experience. There will also be an opportunity for activities where, within\u00a0teams, you will design chemical engineering solutions to important issues or opportunities.\nThis unit is aimed at all engineering students and may be of special interest to those attracted to environmental engineering, biological engineering, civil engineering (water specialisation) and chemical engineering.Read More about Overview",

Large-scale software projects are a critical part of all engineering fields in industry. Perhaps a chemical engineering firm might need a system to simulate biochemical reactions to find better ways for producing green hydrogen. Or a civil engineering firm might need to identify the relationship between changes to playground designs and their impact on safety. Through this unit, you will work on a large-scale software project (web application) in remote teams working independently and collaboratively. The project will give you an appreciation of how large software projects can be decomposed into smaller segments, built and integrated into individual systems. You also gain an understanding of the abilities and limitations of such systems (within the context of web development) and learn methodological processes that support this. You will develop programming skills for web development (HTML, CSS and Javascript). Some prior programming knowledge would be advantageous, but not required.Read More about Overview",

Neural networks are first described and how training can be achieved with backpropagation. Various forms of deep neural networks are developed, such as multilayer perceptrons, convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The mathematics of stochastic optimisation is used to interpret and understand the behaviour and training of these networks. Programming approaches are discussed for training and deploying neural networks. Deep learning technologies and design examples are discussed in areas such as driverless cars, personal cognitive assistants and mastering of games such as GO.Read More about Overview",

From powering household appliances and gas heaters to driving a car across town, it is responsible for making everything that involves movement or activity happen. Although energy cannot be created or destroyed, it is still important for the available energy within our environment to be conserved and used wisely. Our decisions on how we use energy impact the plant's natural systems in complex ways. It is vital that we choose our energy sources carefully and be mindful of the amount of energy we use. The true cost of energy is more than just dollars and cents; there are important environmental and political factors and consequences to consider.\nThis unit provides a qualitative and quantitative survey of the physics behind conventional and alternative energy sources.
