Using control volume analysis the fundamental conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy are developed leading to the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations. Techniques employed to solving these equations for specific problems are explored. Methods of exact and approximate solutions of these equations, and the use of conceptual and analytical tools such as flow similitude, vorticity, circulation, stream function and velocity potential are described. The concept of boundary layers and its use in the calculation of drag and lift forces is elucidated. The origins and physical consequences of the phenomenon of fluid turbulence are discussed, along with their implications for computation of turbulent flows. The analysis of compressible flows and its applications are discussed. The unit introduces the concepts underpinning the broad areas of fluid acoustics, computational fluid dynamics, environmental fluid mechanics and wind energy.Read More about Overview",

Both single and multi-degrees of freedom and discrete and continuous vibratory systems will be analysed. The methods for developing the equations of motion of a vibratory system using Newton's 2nd law and the Lagrange equation and the manipulation of these equations to analyse the free and forced vibration responses of these systems will be introduced. The analysis of forced vibrations will include periodic and non-periodic forcing functions.Read More about Overview",

You will be instructed on the fundamentals of the role of composition and structure of materials in their mechanical properties that are important for engineering design. You will also learn how the materials with undesirable microstructure can lead to premature failures, particularly as a result of their interaction with aggressive environment. The knowledge thus developed will provide a basis for advanced learning on a systematic approach to materials selection as well as the methods by which the materials with the desired mechanical properties can be processed. Case studies will be presented to highlight the importance of selecting appropriate materials for engineering design.Read More about Overview",

Neural networks are first described and how training can be achieved with backpropagation. Various forms of deep neural networks are developed, such as multilayer perceptrons, convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The mathematics of stochastic optimisation is used to interpret and understand the behaviour and training of these networks. Programming approaches are discussed for training and deploying neural networks. Deep learning technologies and design examples are discussed in areas such as driverless cars, personal cognitive assistants and mastering of games such as GO.Read More about Overview",

Examples include turbomachinery, vehicle aerodynamics and aeronautics. It is also a powerful research tool and is being increasingly used to answer fundamental questions in a wide range of fields, from astrophysics to nanomaterials. This Unit provides an introduction to this mathematically sophisticated discipline. This involves a review of the equations governing motion and energy of fluids, the mathematical properties of these equations and the relevance of such properties to obtaining numerical solutions. The basics of numerical discretization and solution methods will be discussed. The Unit will also introduce you to using commercial CFD packages in analysing complex industrial problems involving fluids.Read More about Overview",

The course will encompass sustainability concepts and tools on the potential role of industry in reducing environmental burdens throughout the product life cycle from the extraction of raw materials, to the production of goods, dematerialization, and to the use of those goods and to the management of the resulting waste. The practical applications covered in the course will be based largely on current research in the area of life cycle assessment (LCA). Case studies will be used to demonstrate concepts and principles of industrial ecology with the accomplishments of LCA. The unit would take a systems perspective in seeking the answers to questions such as how to improve resource efficiency; how to minimize waste generation; which material to use considering their costs, supply security, and criticality; and how to design an industrial process to minimize its resource and environmental risks. The unit will be highly beneficial for students, researchers, professionals, policymakers and engineers working in the industries.Read More about Overview",

You will be introduced to the concepts and principles of lean manufacturing and its relationship to sustainability. Using a range of industry case studies, you will evaluate how to maximise customer value while minimising waste. You will learn how to analyse process flows in order to establish capacity and identify bottlenecks. Topics covered include lean concepts, resource minimisation,\u00a0pull vs. push philosophy, just-in time production, value stream mapping, and the impact of these methods on business, environment and social value.Read More about Overview",
