This knowledge is used to design, analyse, build and test a structural component. Simplifications are implicit in the methods used in this analysis. These simplifications will be examined carefully and scrutinised in a broader cross-disciplinary context through problems related to the system being designed. The methods considered will include: the use of simplifications, assumptions, constraints, boundary conditions and levels of required precision. The outcome of the structural analysis and testing will be compared and the suitability of the simplifications used will be scrutinised. You will gain knowledge about the methods engineers use to address complex problems across disciplines. Alongside this “engineering thinking”, you will also gain insight into the role of different specialisations of engineering in society. Communication and teamwork skills will be developed through teamwork tasks.",

In order to simulate a real-world experience, you are required to determine the role of the stakeholders in the project, and consider the economic, environmental, Indigenous, social and ethical aspects of your proposal. You will be working in a team throughout the semester to gain the communication skills which are highly desired by industries. You will be required to reflect on your work to help improve your interpersonal and teamwork skills contributing to your personal growth. You will also consider the value of engineering ethics and the Code of Ethics whilst learning the engineering design process. Engineers need to submit proposals and pitch their ideas to stakeholders within communities and their team members. They will give presentations to their peers, to their project managers, and to possible stakeholders to develop these presentation skills. On completion of this unit, you should be able to participate in multidisciplinary conversations about the engineering design process.",

In order to simulate a real-world experience, you are required to determine the role of the stakeholders in the project, and consider the economic, environmental, Indigenous, social and ethical aspects of your proposal. You will be working in a team throughout the semester to gain the communication skills which are highly desired by industries. You will be required to reflect on your work to help improve your interpersonal and teamwork skills contributing to your personal growth. You will also consider the value of engineering ethics and the Code of Ethics whilst learning the engineering design process. Engineers need to submit proposals and pitch their ideas to stakeholders within communities and their team members. They will give presentations to their peers, to their project managers, and to possible stakeholders to develop these presentation skills. On completion of this unit, you should be able to participate in multidisciplinary conversations about the engineering design process.",

Problems related to these systems will be solved using numerical methods for linear regression, root-finding, integration, ordinary differential equations, and systems of linear equations.

You will be required to reflect on your work to help improve your interpersonal and teamwork skills contributing to your personal growth. You will also consider the value of engineering ethics and the Code of Ethics whilst learning the engineering design process. Engineers need to submit proposals and pitch their ideas to stakeholders within communities and their team members. They will give presentations to their peers, to their project managers, and to possible stakeholders to develop these presentation skills. On completion of this unit, you should be able to participate in multidisciplinary conversations about the engineering design process.",

The unit will then examine a wider range of complex engineering and dynamical systems that do not exhibit analytical solutions. Problems related to these systems will be solved using numerical methods for linear regression, root-finding, integration, ordinary differential equations, and systems of linear equations.

These simplifications will be examined carefully and scrutinised in a broader cross-disciplinary context through problems related to the system being designed. The methods considered will include: the use of simplifications, assumptions, constraints, boundary conditions and levels of required precision. The outcome of the structural analysis and testing will be compared and the suitability of the simplifications used will be scrutinised. You will gain knowledge about the methods engineers use to address complex problems across disciplines. Alongside this “engineering thinking”, you will also gain insight into the role of different specialisations of engineering in society.
