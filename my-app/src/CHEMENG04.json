The unit begins with understanding disturbances, why disturbances need to be controlled and possible responses of various systems to a disturbance. The selection of which variables to control, which variables to manipulate and approaches to interactions are covered, together with the most important types of control loops and computer control systems. Topics include common control scenarios - feed back, feed forward, and cascade systems; ratio control; tuning of PID controllers; single loop and multiple loop systems; interactions and decoupling; process simulation and advanced process control.Read More about Overview",

For a new business, the goal is acquiring investor funding. In a corporate environment, the methodology will help the organisation start new businesses and allocate their internal resources (time, technology, and talent) more efficiently. The unit will be taught in a hands-on way that engages student teams by requiring them to develop hypotheses and then test those hypotheses outside the classroom. Throughout the semester, teams will modify their business models based on feedback from potential customers, and can then decide if there is a worthwhile business to be built. The unit does not include the execution of the business models.Read More about Overview",

On completion of this unit, you will be able to apply their understanding of the main chemical principles underpinning chemical elements, chemical reactivity and equilibria. A number of important topics including atomic structure, bonding and reaction stoichiometry will be developed to prepare students for a deeper exploration of chemistry. The concepts developed within the workshops are complemented through an extended laboratory program where you will have the opportunity to use a variety of analytical techniques and design your own experiments to solve a range of chemical problems.Read More about Overview",

Large-scale software projects are a critical part of all engineering fields in industry. Perhaps a chemical engineering firm might need a system to simulate biochemical reactions to find better ways for producing green hydrogen. Or a civil engineering firm might need to identify the relationship between changes to playground designs and their impact on safety. Through this unit, you will work on a large-scale software project (web application) in remote teams working independently and collaboratively. The project will give you an appreciation of how large software projects can be decomposed into smaller segments, built and integrated into individual systems. You also gain an understanding of the abilities and limitations of such systems (within the context of web development) and learn methodological processes that support this. You will develop programming skills for web development (HTML, CSS and Javascript). Some prior programming knowledge would be advantageous, but not required.Read More about Overview",

In the Newtonian mechanics topics you will explore the traditional concepts of dynamics, such as energy, momentum and angular momentum, and explore their connections and applications to a variety of systems, including rocket propulsion, precession and planetary orbits. Within the Electromagnetism topics you will learn about electric and magnetic fields and their effects, as well as explore techniques for determining these fields and understanding their nature as light. In the Quantum physics topic you will explore modern physics concepts such as the uncertainty principle, the probabilistic interpretation of wave functions and atomic models and stimulated emission and explore their connection to technologies like the atomic force microscope\u00a0and lasers. During the activities for the practical component you will develop measurement, analysis, and communication skills.Read More about Overview",

Neural networks are first described and how training can be achieved with backpropagation. Various forms of deep neural networks are developed, such as multilayer perceptrons, convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The mathematics of stochastic optimisation is used to interpret and understand the behaviour and training of these networks. Programming approaches are discussed for training and deploying neural networks. Deep learning technologies and design examples are discussed in areas such as driverless cars, personal cognitive assistants and mastering of games such as GO.Read More about Overview",

Interactive data visualisation is now common in business, engineering and design and the social and physical sciences. This unit introduces the main kinds of information graphics and interactive visualisation systems and their areas of application. It investigates the reasons why visualisation can be effective and based on this students will gain experience in critically assessing data visualisations and in designing their own visualisations.

Examples include turbomachinery, vehicle aerodynamics and aeronautics. It is also a powerful research tool and is being increasingly used to answer fundamental questions in a wide range of fields, from astrophysics to nanomaterials. This Unit provides an introduction to this mathematically sophisticated discipline. This involves a review of the equations governing motion and energy of fluids, the mathematical properties of these equations and the relevance of such properties to obtaining numerical solutions. The basics of numerical discretization and solution methods will be discussed. The Unit will also introduce you to using commercial CFD packages in analysing complex industrial problems involving fluids.Read More about Overview",

Modern manufacturing management will be presented and discussed to improve quality and productivity by removing non-value added processes to reduce the production cycle and increase the product life-cycle. This will include lean manufacturing, agile manufacturing and virtual manufacturing. This unit also includes the design of flexible manufacturing systems which is capable of producing a variety of products. The manufacturing support systems such as process planning and control and computer-aided process planning using a variant technique and a generative process planning technique with Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be covered in this unit. Finally, the design of flexible manufacturing systems for a variety of products will be studied to reduce production lot size and the design of assembly manufacturing lines will be optimised.Read More about Overview",

Particular emphasis is given to the major functions that combine to allow communication across key modern digital telecommunication systems such as the Internet, mobile telephony, digital TV and Digital Audio Broadcasting.Read More about Overview",

The unit considers the economics of materials production, as well as 'cradle-to-grave' analyses of materials, including products and byproducts of the nuclear fuel cycle. In particular, it looks at various life-cycle analysis techniques.
