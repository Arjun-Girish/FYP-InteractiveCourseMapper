Large-scale software projects are a critical part of all engineering fields in industry. Perhaps a chemical engineering firm might need a system to simulate biochemical reactions to find better ways for producing green hydrogen. Or a civil engineering firm might need to identify the relationship between changes to playground designs and their impact on safety. Through this unit, you will work on a large-scale software project (web application) in remote teams working independently and collaboratively. The project will give you an appreciation of how large software projects can be decomposed into smaller segments, built and integrated into individual systems. You also gain an understanding of the abilities and limitations of such systems (within the context of web development) and learn methodological processes that support this. You will develop programming skills for web development (HTML, CSS and Javascript). Some prior programming knowledge would be advantageous, but not required.Read More about Overview",

Time series will introduce the concepts of stochastic processes, wide-sense stationarity, autocovariance functions and spectral density. This will lead to the analysis of ARMA (p,g) processes using MATLAB. Matrix decomposition includes singular value decomposition with applications including data compression, image processing, noise filtering and finding exact and approximate solutions of linear systems. Numerical methods for working efficiently with large matrices and handling ill-conditioned data will be discussed. Methods for unconstrained and constrained optimisation will be presented, with the use of MATLAB.Read More about Overview",

Major technologies relating to the production, sustainable use and recycling of metals, plastics, glass, electronics, paper and ceramic materials are discussed. Various options involving materials substitution, reclamation, energy recovery and disposal are critically evaluated. The unit considers the economics of materials production, as well as 'cradle-to-grave' analyses of materials, including products and byproducts of the nuclear fuel cycle. In particular, it looks at various life-cycle analysis techniques. We will examine the impact of population, affluence and technology changes on population and ecological footprints with the arrival of the current \"Anthropocene Era\".Read More about Overview",

From powering household appliances and gas heaters to driving a car across town, it is responsible for making everything that involves movement or activity happen. Although energy cannot be created or destroyed, it is still important for the available energy within our environment to be conserved and used wisely. Our decisions on how we use energy impact the plant's natural systems in complex ways. It is vital that we choose our energy sources carefully and be mindful of the amount of energy we use. The true cost of energy is more than just dollars and cents; there are important environmental and political factors and consequences to consider.\nThis unit provides a qualitative and quantitative survey of the physics behind conventional and alternative energy sources.
