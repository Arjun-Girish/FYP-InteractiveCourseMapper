From powering household appliances and gas heaters to driving a car across town, it is responsible for making everything that involves movement or activity happen. Although energy cannot be created or destroyed, it is still important for the available energy within our environment to be conserved and used wisely. Our decisions on how we use energy impact the plant's natural systems in complex ways. It is vital that we choose our energy sources carefully and be mindful of the amount of energy we use. The true cost of energy is more than just dollars and cents; there are important environmental and political factors and consequences to consider.\nThis unit provides a qualitative and quantitative survey of the physics behind conventional and alternative energy sources.

Ecology and biodiversity forms the foundation for understanding conservation and the management of genetics, species and ecosystem diversity. The approach taken is to address core ecological theory, but with an emphasis on contemporary management issues and applications. Topics include the scope and approaches of ecological enquiry; abiotic and biotic factors determining distributions; population growth and regulation; species interactions; patterns and maintenance of biodiversity; food web analysis; disturbance and succession; and production ecology and nutrient cycling. Particular emphasis is placed on integrating ecological processes across spatial and temporal scales. Practical work will be completed via a field excursion together with in-laboratory practical sessions.Read More about Overview",

Recent losses of biota have been caused by habitat loss and degradation, climate change and pollution, the introduction of exotic species and overexploitation of natural resources. Science-based conservation measures are explored that may reduce loss of biodiversity/ecosystem function, including habitat preservation and restoration, combating climate change, and intensive conservation of species. We analyse how conservation efforts may involve trade-offs with biological, economic, social and political factors.Read More about Overview",

The fundamental parameters used to describe deterministic traffic flow behaviour are introduced along with a simple traffic flow model. Stochastic traffic flow behaviour is described via random distributions. Fundamental queuing theory of traffic is briefly introduced. The procedures used to analyse the capacity and level of service are explored for both unsignalised and signalised intersections. The principle of traffic signal operation at isolated intersections is presented. Traffic surveys are discussed. You are introduced to contemporary road safety issues as well. Public transport is considered at the route level concerning the determination of fleet size and factors affecting operational capacity and reliability. Non-motorised transport including cyclists and pedestrians is also considered. In addition, the unit addresses Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Consideration will also be given to the role of communications in the practice of transport and traffic engineers. To enhance your understanding of the unit content from practical points of view, some experts will be invited to give lectures on their relevant work. Throughout the whole unit, the focus is primarily on surface transport systems and applications of advanced technologies therein.Read More about Overview",

Large-scale software projects are a critical part of all engineering fields in industry. Perhaps a chemical engineering firm might need a system to simulate biochemical reactions to find better ways for producing green hydrogen. Or a civil engineering firm might need to identify the relationship between changes to playground designs and their impact on safety. Through this unit, you will work on a large-scale software project (web application) in remote teams working independently and collaboratively. The project will give you an appreciation of how large software projects can be decomposed into smaller segments, built and integrated into individual systems. You also gain an understanding of the abilities and limitations of such systems (within the context of web development) and learn methodological processes that support this. You will develop programming skills for web development (HTML, CSS and Javascript). Some prior programming knowledge would be advantageous, but not required.Read More about Overview",

The fundamental parameters used to describe deterministic traffic flow behaviour are introduced along with a simple traffic flow model. Stochastic traffic flow behaviour is described via random distributions. Fundamental queuing theory of traffic is briefly introduced. The procedures used to analyse the capacity and level of service are explored for both unsignalised and signalised intersections. The principle of traffic signal operation at isolated intersections is presented. Traffic surveys are discussed. You are introduced to contemporary road safety issues as well. Public transport is considered at the route level concerning the determination of fleet size and factors affecting operational capacity and reliability. Non-motorised transport including cyclists and pedestrians is also considered. In addition, the unit addresses Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Consideration will also be given to the role of communications in the practice of transport and traffic engineers. To enhance your understanding of the unit content from practical points of view, some experts will be invited to give lectures on their relevant work. Throughout the whole unit, the focus is primarily on surface transport systems and applications of advanced technologies therein.Read More about Overview",
