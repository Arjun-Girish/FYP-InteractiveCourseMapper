The arrangements of atoms within solids will be explored in detail, with a focus on crystalline materials. The topic of crystallography will be formally explored, including crystal structures, lattices, motifs, symmetry elements and the stereographic projection. There will also be an introduction to defects in crystalline materials, including vacancies, interstitials, dislocations and grain boundaries. The unit will then go on to explore methods for studying such structures and features, discussing diffraction of X\u2010Rays, electrons and light and imaging techniques which underpin the operation of microscopes used to study atomic structure.Read More about Overview",

Phase diagrams and the key concepts of Gibbs energy and chemical potential are used to explain the equilibrium between phases and to predict the microstructures of materials. The mechanisms of new phase formation are discussed in terms of both the driving forces and kinetics of formation, including the role of atomic diffusion. What happens when the thermodynamically stable microstructural state cannot develop is discussed and metastable microstructures are considered in detail. Throughout the unit, technologically important materials systems are used to illustrate these concepts.Read More about Overview",

Some basic mechanics will be introduced, including descriptions of the stress and strain distributions in axial and torsional loading of bars and bending of beams. Elastic properties, including Young\u2019s Modulus and Poisson ratio, will be introduced and linked to the structures of various types of materials (metals, polymers, and composites). Plastic deformation will explore the importance of dislocations in yielding, and deformation via twinning will also be introduced. In both cases, there will be significant attention to how deformation can be prevented and materials can be strengthened. Finally, the unit will cover failure of materials via some selected mechanisms, including brittle fracture and fatigue.Read More about Overview",

The particular focus of this unit is on the electronic properties of materials (metals, semiconductors and insulators) based on their energy band structures. The classical and wave-mechanical models of metals are introduced along with the Fermi energy, density of states, forbidden band and Brillouin zones, to describe the behaviour of free electrons in solids. Semiconductor fabrication processes such as single crystal growth, film deposition and microlithography will also be introduced briefly.Read More about Overview",

New scientific discovery and engineering processes are urgently needed, and chemical engineering must provide key solutions in all three areas. This unit will explore the core concepts and applications of sustainable chemical engineering through interesting case studies drawn from food, water and energy engineering presented by a mix of academic specialists and industry representatives in each area.\nThe basic principles of the discipline will be introduced, including heat and material transfer, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, (bio)chemical reactions engineering and process design/control. Chemical engineering concepts will be developed within workshops and practicals complemented with practical laboratory experience. There will also be an opportunity for activities where, within\u00a0teams, you will design chemical engineering solutions to important issues or opportunities.\nThis unit is aimed at all engineering students and may be of special interest to those attracted to environmental engineering, biological engineering, civil engineering (water specialisation) and chemical engineering.Read More about Overview",

Large-scale software projects are a critical part of all engineering fields in industry. Perhaps a chemical engineering firm might need a system to simulate biochemical reactions to find better ways for producing green hydrogen. Or a civil engineering firm might need to identify the relationship between changes to playground designs and their impact on safety. Through this unit, you will work on a large-scale software project (web application) in remote teams working independently and collaboratively. The project will give you an appreciation of how large software projects can be decomposed into smaller segments, built and integrated into individual systems. You also gain an understanding of the abilities and limitations of such systems (within the context of web development) and learn methodological processes that support this. You will develop programming skills for web development (HTML, CSS and Javascript). Some prior programming knowledge would be advantageous, but not required.Read More about Overview",

Neural networks are first described and how training can be achieved with backpropagation. Various forms of deep neural networks are developed, such as multilayer perceptrons, convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The mathematics of stochastic optimisation is used to interpret and understand the behaviour and training of these networks. Programming approaches are discussed for training and deploying neural networks. Deep learning technologies and design examples are discussed in areas such as driverless cars, personal cognitive assistants and mastering of games such as GO.Read More about Overview",

From powering household appliances and gas heaters to driving a car across town, it is responsible for making everything that involves movement or activity happen. Although energy cannot be created or destroyed, it is still important for the available energy within our environment to be conserved and used wisely. Our decisions on how we use energy impact the plant's natural systems in complex ways. It is vital that we choose our energy sources carefully and be mindful of the amount of energy we use. The true cost of energy is more than just dollars and cents; there are important environmental and political factors and consequences to consider.\nThis unit provides a qualitative and quantitative survey of the physics behind conventional and alternative energy sources.
