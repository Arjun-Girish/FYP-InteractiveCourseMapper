It covers the language C and its implementation on a typical computer, including standard data types, arrays, control statements, functions, including ways of parameter passing, C library functions, pointers, strings, arrays of pointers, structures, linked lists and binary tree data structures, dynamic memory allocations, and calls to assembly language programs. Object-oriented programming is introduced. Software engineering is covered as the methodology of software development and lifecycle models. Operating system concepts are introduced. The unit also includes an introduction to programmable logic controllers (PLCs).Read More about Overview",

The treatment of probability includes elementary set operations, sample spaces and probability laws, conditional probability, independence, and notions of combinatorics. A discussion of discrete and continuous random variables, common distributions, functions, and expectations forms an important part of this unit. Transform methods, limit theorems, convergences, and bounding techniques are also covered. Special consideration is given to the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Markov chain, transition probabilities and steady state distribution will be discussed.\nApplication examples from engineering, science, and statistics will be provided: The Gaussian distribution in source and channel coding, the exponential, Chi-square, and Gamma distributions in wireless communications and Bayesian statistics, the Rayleigh distribution in wireless communications, the Cauchy distribution in detection theory, the Poisson and Erlang distributions in traffic engineering, queuing theory and networking, the Gaussian, Laplacian and generalised Gaussian distributions in image processing, the Weibull distribution in high voltage engineering and electrical insulation, Markov chain in queuing theory, and first-order Markov process in predictive speech/image compression.Read More about Overview",

Then thyristor rectifiers and switched power converters are presented, looking at their use for electrical energy conversion in general and variable speed motor control in particular. Finally, single and three phase AC networks, power factor correction, and electrical power generation, transmission and distribution networks are explored. Particular focus is given here to three phase transformers, transmission line modelling, quality of electrical supply, electrical protection systems, and power system control.Read More about Overview",

You will use linear and non-linear electronics, computer engineering and communications engineering to tackle a group project, apply project management skills and extend your experience of working in groups. The project will extend the design processes introduced in the earlier units to a larger, more complex and less constrained problem that integrates multiple sub-disciplines of your course. The project will be complemented by lectures in project management, including working with teams, project management tools and techniques, and written and verbal communication. Frameworks for analysing the life cycles of systems are introduced. Tools and techniques to aid decision-making are provided.Read More about Overview",

Many protocols used in the application, transport, and network layers are examined and analysed. Client-server and peer-to-peer application architectures and their features are compared and contrasted. Reliable communication over an unreliable network layer, connection establishment and teardown, and multiplexing issues are covered. Protocols for network security, techniques for providing confidentiality, authentication, non-repudiation and message integrity are also studied. Finally, protocols used for network management are analysed.Read More about Overview",

It also introduces simulation methods. First, performance modelling of a packet switch is covered. Then, a comparative analysis of routing algorithms is covered from a graph theory perspective. Third, methods to provide an integrated service to a set of traffic demands with different qualities of service are studied. Then, congestion in telecommunication networks is covered, and effectiveness of various congestion and flow control algorithms and protocols are investigated. The focus then shifts to individual links and nodes, and queuing theory is introduced and its applications in networks are analysed. Then, recent advances are studied to show how the analytical and simulation knowledge learnt in this unit could be applied in real life.Read More about Overview",

It includes compression of multimedia from basic information theoretic concepts through to advanced video (e.g. MPEG), image (JPEG, JPEG2000) and audio (CELP, MP3, AAC, Dolby Digital) coding. XML-based metadata systems are used to illustrate concepts of content characterisation and discovery. The ability of modern network protocols to support media streaming is related directly to service requirements such as error and delay tolerance. Where media is intended for human consumption, the characteristics of human perception of image and sound determine minimum quality requirements, but also reveal limitations that can be exploited when compressing media data. Machine interpretation and analysis of multimedia is also investigated. Case studies in media analysis (e.g. Shazam), delivery (video on demand) and consumption (digital cinema) are used to illustrate the technologies investigated.Read More about Overview",

The core of the unit is intelligent infrastructure for Smart Grid and its heightening vulnerability, and how to protect it effectively.\nThe basic economic fundamentals of power systems and conventional and renewable power generation in regulated and deregulated environment are introduced first. The basic concepts of intelligent control, application of intelligent agents in grid technology, and intelligent components commonly used in Smart Grids are extensively discussed afterward. Also included is how distribution networks adapt to intermittent energy sources (e.g. solar and wind) through the use of smart grids, emerging technologies and energy storage systems.\nThe unit will conclude with defining concept, design and purpose of the Smart Grid, reviewing current and relevant technologies developed, assessing its vulnerabilities to a cyber-attack, and finding effective protective mechanisms for the grid.Read More about Overview",

In particular, tools and techniques for power flow, symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults, voltage control, frequency control, and system stability will be studied in detail. Finally, electromagnetic transients in power systems will be introduced.Read More about Overview",

The media covered include vacuum/air, radio frequency (RF) and microwave transmission lines, metallic waveguides, planar optical waveguides and optical fibres.\nThe unit also explores different types of antennas that can be used to generate electromagnetic waves. In addition to these, the unit covers concepts related to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Using these concepts, the unit explores practical problems such as interference and coupling in RF/microwave circuits and discusses solutions such as grounding, shielding and filtering. In each section of this unit, the learned theory is related to real-world applications to expand your understanding.Read More about Overview",

It includes compression of multimedia from basic information theoretic concepts through to advanced video (e.g. MPEG), image (JPEG, JPEG2000) and audio (CELP, MP3, AAC, Dolby Digital) coding. XML-based metadata systems are used to illustrate concepts of content characterisation and discovery. The ability of modern network protocols to support media streaming is related directly to service requirements such as error and delay tolerance. Where media is intended for human consumption, the characteristics of human perception of image and sound determine minimum quality requirements, but also reveal limitations that can be exploited when compressing media data. Machine interpretation and analysis of multimedia is also investigated. Case studies in media analysis (e.g. Shazam), delivery (video on demand) and consumption (digital cinema) are used to illustrate the technologies investigated.Read More about Overview",

Neural networks are first described and how training can be achieved with backpropagation. Various forms of deep neural networks are developed, such as multilayer perceptrons, convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The mathematics of stochastic optimisation is used to interpret and understand the behaviour and training of these networks. Programming approaches are discussed for training and deploying neural networks. Deep learning technologies and design examples are discussed in areas such as driverless cars, personal cognitive assistants and mastering of games such as GO.Read More about Overview",
