Neural networks are first described and how training can be achieved with backpropagation. Various forms of deep neural networks are developed, such as multilayer perceptrons, convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The mathematics of stochastic optimisation is used to interpret and understand the behaviour and training of these networks. Programming approaches are discussed for training and deploying neural networks. Deep learning technologies and design examples are discussed in areas such as driverless cars, personal cognitive assistants and mastering of games such as GO.Read More about Overview",

The project will extend the design processes introduced in the earlier units to a larger, more complex and less constrained problem that integrates multiple sub-disciplines of your course. The project will be complemented by lectures in project management, including working with teams, project management tools and techniques, and written and verbal communication. Frameworks for analysing the life cycles of systems are introduced. Tools and techniques to aid decision-making are provided.",

The unit introduces concepts of continuous-time and discrete-time signals, their sampling and aliasing issues. Complex numbers, in particular, complex exponentials are introduced along with their representation as phasors, leading to periodic waveforms, Fourier series and the signal frequency spectrum. Modification of spectra will be described using FIR filters, discrete-time systems, the unit-sample response, discrete convolution, linear time-invariant systems, convolution integrals, the continuous-time Fourier transform, windowing, DFT, FFT, time-frequency spectrum analysis, spectrogram, and Laplace Transform. Connecting frequency response and time response completes the unit.Read More about Overview",

It includes compression of multimedia from basic information theoretic concepts through to advanced video (e.g. MPEG), image (JPEG, JPEG2000) and audio (CELP, MP3, AAC, Dolby Digital) coding. XML-based metadata systems are used to illustrate concepts of content characterisation and discovery. The ability of modern network protocols to support media streaming is related directly to service requirements such as error and delay tolerance. Where media is intended for human consumption, the characteristics of human perception of image and sound determine minimum quality requirements, but also reveal limitations that can be exploited when compressing media data. Machine interpretation and analysis of multimedia is also investigated. Case studies in media analysis (e.g. Shazam), delivery (video on demand) and consumption (digital cinema) are used to illustrate the technologies investigated.Read More about Overview",

Large-scale software projects are a critical part of all engineering fields in industry. Perhaps a chemical engineering firm might need a system to simulate biochemical reactions to find better ways for producing green hydrogen. Or a civil engineering firm might need to identify the relationship between changes to playground designs and their impact on safety. Through this unit, you will work on a large-scale software project (web application) in remote teams working independently and collaboratively. The project will give you an appreciation of how large software projects can be decomposed into smaller segments, built and integrated into individual systems. You also gain an understanding of the abilities and limitations of such systems (within the context of web development) and learn methodological processes that support this. You will develop programming skills for web development (HTML, CSS and Javascript). Some prior programming knowledge would be advantageous, but not required.Read More about Overview",

Major technologies relating to the production, sustainable use and recycling of metals, plastics, glass, electronics, paper and ceramic materials are discussed. Various options involving materials substitution, reclamation, energy recovery and disposal are critically evaluated. The unit considers the economics of materials production, as well as 'cradle-to-grave' analyses of materials, including products and byproducts of the nuclear fuel cycle. In particular, it looks at various life-cycle analysis techniques. We will examine the impact of population, affluence and technology changes on population and ecological footprints with the arrival of the current \"Anthropocene Era\".Read More about Overview",

From powering household appliances and gas heaters to driving a car across town, it is responsible for making everything that involves movement or activity happen. Although energy cannot be created or destroyed, it is still important for the available energy within our environment to be conserved and used wisely. Our decisions on how we use energy impact the plant's natural systems in complex ways. It is vital that we choose our energy sources carefully and be mindful of the amount of energy we use. The true cost of energy is more than just dollars and cents; there are important environmental and political factors and consequences to consider.\nThis unit provides a qualitative and quantitative survey of the physics behind conventional and alternative energy sources.
